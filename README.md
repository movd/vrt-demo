## Abstract

The abstract for my talk was as follows:

>The webmaster team of the Regional Computer Center (RRZK) of the University of Cologne provides the various university institutions with centrally administered TYPO3 CMS systems. On hundreds of domains, the university thus pressents it self on the web in all its diversity.  
> The systems are of course continuously maintained and updated. However, every change or correction carries the risk of side effects and errors at an unexpected place in the system. Regression tests have the task of preventing this. Since last year, RRZK has been using visual end-to-end tests to test the websites for updates from the perspective of end users.
>
> Based on the situation at the University of Cologne, the presentation will introduce the tools and libraries used at the RRZK and show that even classic CMS systems can be continuously tested with modern means (NodeJS, Headless Chrome via Puppeteer and ResembleJS).
